# FossOssTLD (codename WeCan)
Simple hosts system that allows you to access .foss/.oss TLD(s) more to come.

This project is a WiP that will provide a browser extension that will allow you to access .foss and .oss TLDs, this addon will check the URL you are trying to access, and if it detects you are looking for a domain.foss or domain.oss it will have the IP ready (which it will load from this repo via hosts file) 

We are also planning on creating a script that will pull the latest hosts file and insert it into your system host file, that way it is accessable systemwide.
